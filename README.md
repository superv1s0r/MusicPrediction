# MusicPrediction

This project classifies music genres based on audio features extracted using **librosa** (it was done beforehand, you won't have to do it) and trained using **XGBoost**. It utilizes machine learning techniques for feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- A virtual environment manager (e.g., `venv`, `virtualenv`, or `conda`)

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/superv1s0r/MusicPrediction.git
   cd MusicPrediction

2. **Create a virtual environment: If you're using venv (standard for Python 3)**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   
3. **Active the environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
5. **Run the model**:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```
